/// # Highly divisible triangular number
/// The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
///
/// 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
///
/// Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
///
///  1: 1
///  3: 1,3
///  6: 1,2,3,6
/// 10: 1,2,5,10
/// 15: 1,3,5,15
/// 21: 1,3,7,21
/// 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28
/// We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.
///
/// What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
